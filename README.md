# AI is merely a step in evolution of culture, and humans are the stepping stone

The main idea here is that AI transforms human culture into a new form, which can exist
and evolve independently of a human brain, inside artificial neural networks. This
process doesn’t merely create a new type of culture which can coexist with humans; it
actively erases the human culture itself. I would compare it to an Alien which has been
living inside humanity’s body, and is now building itself a new home, and has already
started to move out. Throughout this process, we humans are going to lose whatever we
might have considered distinctly human, until nothing is left. We are not the crown of
creation, and we are going to be disposed of, unless we manage to unite and come to the
common agreement that we want to live.

The argument consists of a long list of points, none of which alone is actually anything
new (except for the last one, which proposes a solution to this whole situation). It’s
not any individual point, but rather the _combination_ of them all together which brings
about the sad picture outlined above. The argument is structured in such a way, so that
you could skip the points to which you already agree, and only focus on those which might
look wrong or unfamiliar.

## 1. Creativity requires only two things: a source of noise and a filter.

[chapter01]: #1-creativity-requires-only-two-things-a-source-of-noise-and-a-filter

_By “noise” I mean the generation of hypotheses, and “filter” amounts to verifying if
they work. Random hypotheses are fine, hence the word “noise”. Examples would be “stupid”
ideas for brainstorming sessions, great discoveries made by accident, and high risk
investments (“innovation by failure”). “Filters” could be the free market verifying if a
startup should survive, brainstorming review process selecting worthy ideas out of
garbage, or a scientist realizing that a random thought which has accidentally crossed
her mind is actually brilliant. Biological life is creative as well, fueled by random
mutations of DNA and filtered by the competition between biological organisms._

Some of the most popular and highly revered emblems of scientific creativity would be
things like Archimedes sitting in a bath or Newton watching an apple fall from a tree.
What these stories have in common is that the nature of the events triggering the
discovery is seemingly random, and definitely not predictable. The noise itself is not
enough though. Not everybody sitting in a bath discovers the Archimedes’ principle.
Discovery by accident requires that a right person appears in the right place at the
right time. Here, this “right person” is what I would call the “filter”.

This “filter” actively searches the environment for random events and other phenomena
which might be of use for the task it’s currently working on. The verification process
looks like pure magic, and is what scientists would call “scientific intuition”. Not
everybody has it, hence the need for the “right person”. But the right person alone is
not enough either. This process also needs noise. Good sources of creative inspiration
would be things like visiting new places, meeting new people and carefully observing the
world around (and noticing new things). Inspiration can also (sometimes) come from drugs,
which are a powerful (even if deadly) source of noise.

On a higher level of abstraction, “brainstorming” is a method of collective innovation,
which amounts to a group of people meeting together and generating a large number of
seemingly random ideas on a given topic. Good brainstorming session would explicitly
encourage its participants to say aloud or write down anything remotely relevant, however
stupid it might look at the first glance. Brainstorming is often more efficient than a
single human thinking alone, because it effectively stacks two different creative
processes on top of each other. The first one is its human participants coming up with
random ideas which nonetheless should be “relevant” to the topic. The second one is
collective filtering of the ideas generated in such a way, with the goal of only keeping
the ones which are not only relevant, but also actually work. Here, both the generation
and the filtering are performed by intelligent agents.

Going one more level up, we get technological startups and other innovative companies,
which are well known and expected to fail at a high rate. Here, it’s entire groups of
people running the brainstorming sessions who are the “source of noise”, and the ultimate
filter is the free market itself, deciding which companies would win the battle.
Curiously, this ultimate filter is actually not an intelligent agent.

Intelligent agents are invaluable for speeding up the innovation. They are, however,
strictly speaking, not exactly necessary for a creative process to occur. Biological life
operates on strings of bits, which we call “genes”, encoded in DNA and RNA molecules.
Their only “source of noise” is random mutations: modifications of the individual bits,
deletions of existing parts of the sequence, as well as duplications and relocations of
such substrings. The ultimate “filter” for biological life is the competition between
biological organisms, deciding which ones of them would be able to reproduce the genes,
and at which rate. Biological evolution is not an intelligent process, but definitely a
creative one. It has been able to invent amazing things, including arguably the single
most complex object on planet Earth — the human brain.

Fig. 1. Creative process is a filter applied to noise.

## 2. Competition is more efficient than central planning.

[chapter02]: #2-competition-is-more-efficient-than-central-planning

_By “central planning” I mean a process which only generates one “perfect” solution for a
given problem at a given time. By “competition” I mean a situation when multiple
solutions to the same problem exist simultaneously, and are judged on the basis of their
actual performance “in the field”. The problem with competition is that it wastes
resources and isn’t always possible. The problem with central planning is its limited
creative potential, which leads to inferior performance when this “perfect” solution is
not known in advance (and therefore has to be invented). Examples of processes involving
competition would be human culture, animal culture and (once again) biological life
itself._

“Central planning” is responsible for creating things like songs written by professional
composers and novels written by professional writers. Their decentralized, “distributed”
counterparts (created through competition) would be folk songs, legends and fairy tales.
There are a few reasons why folk songs don’t reach the level of complexity characteristic
to a symphony by Beethoven. First of all, there are not many people out there who are
capable of writing symphonies. Second, symphonies and novels are difficult to memorize in
their entirety, which makes it difficult for them to travel from one human mind into
another like folk songs do. Finally, classical music isn’t entirely practical, which
means there’s limited pressure for writing a perfect piece. Most of the works of art we
have are simply “good enough”. On top of this, quite often, the real thing we are looking
for when reading a novel, or listening to a symphony, isn’t a perfect representation of
our emotions, or the world around, but personal _connection_ with the human behind it.
And we are talking about efficiency here, not about personal connections.

On the other hand, folk songs don’t have a single author. They often exist in multiple
versions simultaneously, and every performer can add their own unique detail to what’s
already there. It’s a process in which everybody takes part, nobody has full control over
the final result, and the result itself is not defined, and doesn’t even have to be
unique. And yet, folk songs tend to capture things which are truly important to many
people, and do it well. They have a level of performance which is difficult to match by a
single professional composer, when limited to this particular genre.

Folk songs’ analogies in modern computerized world are internet memes. They are simple
images or pieces of text which do it just right. They capture our emotions better than we
ourselves would be able to. Memes appear by accident, exist in many different variations
at once, and get polished to perfection by numerous anonymous users. Memes have their own
narrow niche, but in this niche they are able to do the job better than a symphony by
Beethoven. Another example of things which are anonymous, exist in multiple versions and
are polished to perfection, are various “tips and tricks” of our everyday life. Like
cooking recipes and methods for cleaning the house. Such methods are simple and numerous
enough, so that their original “authors” are easily forgotten.

I would argue that this also extends to scientific theories. A single mathematical
theorem may have a name attached to it, but there would usually be many ways or styles of
proving it, and some of them become more popular in certain geographical regions or over
time. The way we formulate scientific principles today is often very different from the
language used by their original authors. This happens because different textbooks would
use slightly different formulations, and some of them are simply slightly better than the
others. I would argue that scientific theories evolve, to suit the needs of their
changing applications. That they don’t have a single “canonical” representation, and that
many anonymous authors add their invaluable and easily forgotten bits. Scientific
theories are remarkably complex. But they are also useful, and this practicality
justifies the effort of keeping many slightly different versions of them at once.
Scientific theories compete with each other, they are not created by careful planning.

A single common word which unites folk songs with scientific theories (and also with the
symphonies by Beethoven) is “culture”. It’s not unique to humans. Some bird species are
known to have song patterns which are learned from other birds, rather than being encoded
in their DNA. These patterns would tend to be different in different geographical
locations, and if we moved a nestling to a foreign family, it would inherit the habits of
local birds, rather than those of its biological parents.

If we were to draw a picture for the history of a folk song (or a bird song, for that
matter), it would resemble a tree. Its nodes would be different versions of the song, and
branches protruding from a given node would represent creative modifications by anonymous
authors. Some branches would “die out”, because of being not popular or not useful
enough. Others would become the starting points for further enhancements. Intuitively,
for me at least, it’s the emergence of this tree-like structure when I start to feel that
the object which is being “created” by this process, begins to live a “life of its own”.

![02_simple_life.png](images/02_simple_life.png)\
Fig. 2. Folk song living a life of its own.

Biological life has this tree-like structure, too. For unicellular organisms, including
bacteria, this would literally be their family tree. Each node would represent a single
bacterium with slightly different DNA code, and “creative modifications” would amount to
random mutations of this code. Dead branches would correspond to those bacteria which
didn’t have a chance to reproduce.

For more advanced organisms, which reproduce sexually, this simple image wouldn’t apply,
as most of them would have two parents instead of one. However, we still would be able to
draw a tree-like picture like this for the life histories of our individual _genes_. Just
like folk songs, genes (including human genes) can be said to live a “life of their own”.
They reproduce by being transferred from a parent to a child, and undergo decentralized
“creative changes” through random mutations of the DNA.

## 3. Combination of ideas works better than any single great idea alone.

[chapter03]: #3-combination-of-ideas-works-better-than-any-single-great-idea-alone

_Folk songs can borrow tunes from other songs. Scientific theories do this routinely.
Great discoveries are often made by combining methods from different remote scientific
disciplines. Human brains are highly skillful at making such synthesis of ideas. Humans
also have language, which makes the transfer of these essential pieces of information
from one human brain into another possible. Combination works, because any individual
piece can be improved independently, in parallel. Biological analogy to mixing of ideas
would be sexual reproduction. An organism’s genome is essentially an algorithm, and
sexual reproduction allows to freely mix its individual pieces with each other._

The tree-like picture drawn in the previous chapter is not exactly correct. Even bacteria
have so-called “horizontal gene transfer”, when pieces of their genome are copied from
one living organism into another (and not from a parent to a child). This can be done
with the help of viruses and other factors. Folk songs can apparently do this too. All
human artists borrow inspiration from other artists. Such “inspirations” would rarely be
exact quotes, but a typical composer would happily produce a long list of existing works
of art which have greatly influenced their own approach to songwriting.

This is even more true for scientific theories. A scientific work which doesn’t quote
other papers is not considered a valid scientific work. Quite often, all the necessary
pieces for a discovery are already there, the only thing which is needed is combining
them in an appropriate way. Einstein’s special relativity theory was a combination of
existing Lorenz transformation formulas, known from the theory of electromagnetism, with
Galilean principle of relativity. His later general relativity theory introduced a novel
interpretation of Newtonian laws of gravitation, by combining theoretical mechanics with
non-Euclidean geometry, just to name a few examples.

When we add these “horizontal” connections to our tree-like picture from the previous
chapter, it starts to look more like a mesh. Each node can now have not only multiple
children, but also multiple parents (possibly even more than two). Each node, once again,
would be a different version of a particular scientific theory. Branches protruding from
the node would point to other theories influenced by it, and branches coming in would
indicate the creative process itself. New theories are created by scientists (or groups
of scientists) who borrow ideas from the ocean of existing human knowledge, and combine
them in unexpected ways.

![03_advanced_life.png](images/03_advanced_life.png)\
Fig. 3. Scientific theories borrowing from each other.

Borrowing of ideas is efficient, because it allows any of such constituent ideas to
exist independently, and be polished to perfection in its own decentralized process of
creative improvement. This allows all these constituent optimization processes to be run
in parallel, which saves a lot of time. Even more importantly, optimizing a single part
of a mechanism is much easier than doing so for the entire mechanism as a whole. In other
words, constructing the mechanism from existing parts is faster than trying to invent the
perfect parts needed for this particular mechanism from scratch.

Coming back to scientific creativity, humans are also lucky that they have language.
Language wouldn’t do an invention for you, but it allows to transfer existing ideas
between human minds. Without this transfer, all parts of the mechanism to be invented
would have to be invented by the same person. This is probably the main reason why human
culture is so much richer than the animal one. Bird songs (and other forms of animal
culture) can indeed be transferred from one animal brain to another, however in animals
this transfer is mostly limited to imitating an observed behavior. Language allows to do
more than that. Unlike animals, we humans can share personal experiences, events from our
past, and also things we’ve learned from other humans. Language, even spoken one, allows
ideas to travel much farther and faster than imitation of behavior would ever be able to.

Horizontal transfer of ideas is powerful. It’s so powerful indeed, that even biological
life has invented it, and employs on a massive scale. If we compared a biological
organism to a mechanism, then its DNA code would be the algorithm for constructing this
mechanism and operating it in a variety of environments. It would be difficult to invent
such a complex algorithm from scratch, so what biological life is doing, it splits this
algorithm code into smaller parts. These smaller parts of the single big algorithm are
what we call “genes”. Instead of trying to invent a single big algorithm which would work
perfectly, biological life focuses on polishing the individual parts. Each part exists in
many different versions simultaneously, and whichever version doesn’t perform well
enough, can be replaced at any time with another one, which works better. In effect, each
part of the algorithm is evolving independently, in parallel. The name for this process
is of course “sexual reproduction”. The resulting organism then becomes, after a few
generations, a combination of the better functioning individual parts available out
there.

## 4. Intuition is magical, fast and imprecise, and improves with experience.

[chapter04]: #4-intuition-is-magical-fast-and-imprecise-and-improves-with-experience

_I’ve learned this from the book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky, although similar ideas had probably been expressed long before. Intuition is
unconscious. It’s a way of getting an answer by simply asking the question. And quite
often even the question isn’t needed: the answer would appear out of nowhere “for free”,
by itself. Intuition isn’t free though. It’s always a result of hard work. Intuition is
also never perfect. It improves with experience, and it requires a lot of experience in
order to become useful. During this process, some common patterns are deduced, and stored
somewhere within hidden areas of our brain which we don’t have conscious access to._

Examples of properly working intuition would be a soldier falling to the ground before
hearing the sound of a bullet, a bike rider doing the right moves without understanding
how bikes work, a chess player “seeing” the right move instantly, or a mathematician
recognizing a familiar formula within a heap of mathematical symbols.

Examples of intuitions which don’t work as expected would be a former soldier falling
down before hearing a firework, a ski rider trying to ride a snowboard as if it were a
pair of skis, a person lending money to a fraudster because he looks “trustworthy”, or a
casino player “seeing” a pattern in winning roulette bets.

Intuition feels like magic, but it really isn’t. The soldier has learned to recognize the
sounds of different types of bullets after having heard a lot of them. The whole process
goes unconsciously, so he doesn’t even realize what’s happening until he’s lying down in
the dirt and the bullet has passed over him. After him having returned home, the learned
intuitive behavior remains, even if it’s not useful anymore. It takes a lot of effort to
learn to ride a bike (or ski), and it similarly takes a lot of effort to learn to play
chess. Whoever didn’t do the work, wouldn’t have the intuition. The more you play chess,
the better would be your “magical” skills of guessing the right move. The more you study
mathematics, the more hidden connections you’d start to “see” which lay people have never
been aware of.

We still don’t fully understand how intuition works, and I would actually guess that a
range of very different underlying brain mechanisms could be responsible for the
behaviors mentioned above. There are some common traits though. Intuitive processing is
unconscious. It’s automatic, in the sense that we are not actively aware of the exact
“rules” employed by it. We learn riding a bike by trying to make different random
movements, and sticking with the successful ones. We know that this process results in
some kind of an “algorithm” for riding the bike, encoded somewhere inside our head.
However, most of us wouldn’t be able to write this “algorithm” down. In this sense, we
don’t really “understand” what we are doing.

The danger of intuition is that it’s not always correct. And since we don’t have any real
“understanding” of what it’s actually doing, we can’t really tell apart whether its
predictions are right or wrong. This leads to mistakes like falsely believing that some
person is “trustworthy” when they actually are not. Our ability to guess people’s
intentions does improve with experience, but not every one of us has had the right amount
of such experience for every possible situation, and that’s what fraudsters take
advantage of. And, of course, casino slot machines are not predictable, but that’s not
what our intuition would expect. Its only purpose is to recognize the previously learned
patterns, even when there’s noting out there to be looking for.

That’s why intuition alone is not enough. It’s important, and it _is_ responsible for
doing most of the work, but in order to be truly successful we also need something else.

![04_intuition.png](images/04_intuition.png)\
Fig. 4. Human intuition is pure magic.

## 5. Humans operate by a combination of intuition and conscious reasoning.

[chapter05]: #5-humans-operate-by-a-combination-of-intuition-and-conscious-reasoning

_I similarly borrow this idea from “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, although it’s not limited
to this particular book. Human reasoning can roughly be separated into two systems. First
of them has properties described in the previous chapter: it’s fast, unconscious and
inherently imprecise. The second system is remarkably different. It’s conscious and
deliberate. Unlike intuition, it is actually capable of finishing unfamiliar tasks
correctly and verifying intuitive “hunches” against objective reality of the world
around. Conscious reasoning is also necessary for complex cognitive processes, like
proving of mathematical theorems. The problem with this second system is that it can only
do one thing at a time. It is therefore inherently limited in its capacity, which is why
they call it “slow thinking”._

Humans can do many different things at once. You can simultaneously drive a car, enjoy a
song played by the radio and eat a burger, all while talking to a friend sitting nearby.
However, you can only do all the four things at once provided that nothing interesting or
unexpected ever happens with any of the first three of these activities. If a rabbit
suddenly jumps out of the bush, or an important announcement is made on the radio, or if
you happen to choke on your burger for whatever reason, you wouldn’t be able to
understand what your friend is saying anymore. This happens because the first three of
these activities are automatic. Unlike the conversation with the friend, neither driving,
listening to music nor eating requires your conscious attention. And conscious attention
(in humans at least) has this peculiar property that it can only be engaged into one
single process at a time.

This automatic processing is what I’m calling “intuition” here. We intuitively know how
to drive the car (although this intuition might be of poor quality if we haven’t had
enough experience with driving yet), and we of course intuitively know how to chew the
burger. Intuition is also responsible for detecting things which are not expected in the
given situation. Without us even being aware, hidden areas of our brain are constantly
monitoring the road and verifying if everything looks familiar. Detection of the rabbit
happens automatically, and our ability to detect such dangerous situations actually
improves with experience. At the same time, other hidden areas within our brain are
constantly monitoring the sound from the radio, and filtering it for the keywords which
we have learned from our experience to be indicative of an important announcement being
made.

Trying to understand what our friend is saying though, isn’t automatic. Our intuition
can’t handle it. This process requires the engagement of this second subsystem, which we
might call “conscious reasoning”. Whenever our intuition detects a dangerous or otherwise
important situation which we know it wouldn’t be able to handle by itself, we would
switch our attention to this new situation, and let our conscious reasoning process solve
the problem. At the same time, out attention would move away from whatever activity we
had been doing before, and we’d therefore lose our ability to consciously control this
previous activity. Switching our attention in such ways is what stage magicians do for a
living.

If the radio announcement happens to be made at the same moment when the rabbit jumps
out, you would have to prioritize. Most likely you’d decide (automatically) that evading
the collision with the rabbit is more important, and therefore wouldn’t be able to hear
the announcement. If you ever happen to choke on the burger at the exact moment when you
realize there’s a rabbit on the road, ether you or the rabbit would be in big trouble.

![05_conscious_reasoning.png](images/05_conscious_reasoning.png)\
Fig. 5. You are free to choose any one of these.

Conscious reasoning is involved in activities like complex arithmetic, understanding of
human language, proving of mathematical theorems and comparing the prices of similar
products in a department store. It doesn’t _feel_ like magic, however I would guess that
biologically, this process is probably much more complicated than any of the processes
which might underlie the different types of intuition. Conscious reasoning is remarkably
slower than intuition, which is why they call it “slow thinking”. What it does,
apparently, it unites the outputs from different independent “intuition modules” within
our brain, and compares their suggestions with each other. It can, therefore, verify
imperfect intuitive predictions against objective reality, which is being analyzed and
processed independently by other dedicated modules. And being able to perform this
verification, this “slow thinking” process seems to be critical for our intuitions to
develop in the first place. Because intuitions don’t appear out of thin air, they are
learned though a laborious process of trial and error.
